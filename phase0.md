### The hunt begins 

While at google i/o, there were a lot of references to Alex Meddleton who lost his fish. There were tweets flying around, during the keynote on some pre-slides there was a `HELP I LOST MY FISH MESSAGE` as well.

### Business Cards

Scattered at the firebase area in google i/o were hundreds of these cards.

### Email

Emailing the address on the business card results in this auto reply email:

```
Hi,

Iâ€™m currently busy trying to locate a missing fish. Could you help? It was last seen at firebase.foo. I might be able to give you an I/O 2017 ticket if you help me find it.

Sincerely,

Alex

### Call

If you call the following number (415) 799-1261, you get a google voice number of a robo-googler. He says he lost his fish and your efforts will be in vain. Then he puts you on hold with some robo music.
